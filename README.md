# Outlier Detection in Machine Learning Jupyter Notebook

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook presents a comprehensive guide to outlier detection in machine learning. It's designed to provide both theoretical insights and practical coding examples to handle outliers in various datasets.

## Key Features

- **Theoretical Background:** Begins with a brief introduction to outliers, their impact on machine learning models, and why it's crucial to detect and handle them appropriately.
- **Data Exploration:** Illustrates methods to explore datasets for potential outliers using statistical summaries and visualization techniques.
- **Detection Techniques:** Explores multiple methods for detecting outliers, including statistical approaches (like Z-score and IQR method), as well as machine learning-based methods.
- **Handling Outliers:** Discusses and demonstrates strategies for handling outliers, such as removal, transformation, or using robust models.
- **Case Studies:** Includes real-world case studies where outlier detection is applied to different datasets, providing a practical perspective.
- **Interactive Code Blocks:** Contains Python code blocks that can be executed interactively to understand the concepts in real-time.
- **Libraries and Tools:** Utilizes popular Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.
